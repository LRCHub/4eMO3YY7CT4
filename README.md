# MAN WITH A MISSION – REACHING FOR THE SKY

```
Walking back now
In my memory lane
Something changed
from I thought what was mine
In the blue town
As I'm feeling vague
Flipping through blank pages
with no line
切り裂かれそうな光が
路地裏を無機質に染め
見渡す限りの嘘が
僕らの痛みをやわらげる
You should try it
It's the time to dare
We should try it
Don't be scared of bystanders
さざめいた街の灯が
俯く足音掻き消し
傷付いた胸抱き
僕らはただ空見上げる
Don't be afraid, be afraid
誰だって 迷い戸惑っているんだ
Don't you change,
don't you change
いつだって ありのままの顔見せて
You should try it
It's the time to dare
We should try it
Don't you care?
Reaching for the sky
I will not stay
Won't hesitate, live for today
My hands are in the air
Reaching for the sky
I will not pray to find my way
I can go anywhere
All the burden
All the junk I made
Squeezing, weighing on
my futurе all along
In the rain now,
like a waterfall
Sanctifiеs every sadness and
the wrong
あの雲の空の彼方
暗闇よりもっと先だろう
新たに訪れる陽が
僕らに微笑むように
You should try it
It's the time to dare
We should try it
Don't you care?
Reaching for the sky
I will not stay
Won't hesitate, live for today
My hands are in the air
Reaching for the sky
I will not pray to find my way
I can go anywhere
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
So don't you ever fold the game?
There's still some more for us
to bet, and us to play
The goal is there,
the others come for us to claim
But we will not give in
We'll never be engaged
or tamed, proclaim in ya name
Don't you fold the game
The call is yours
Don't you ever fold the game
The call is yours
Don't you ever fold your game
The call is yours
Don't you ever fold the game
The call is yours
Don't you ever fold your game
