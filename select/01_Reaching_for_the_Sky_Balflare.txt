There are some who's livin in the shadows
Waiting for the end in obscure alleys
Afraid of coming out into the light
They suffer 'cuz they're different as night is to day
People look down on them
Even though they know that they're in the wrong
I once lived in that lonely and secluded shell
And then i met an angel, so sweet
Who believed that love could cure anything

And into the warmth of daylight!

Hey! it's great to be alive
Hiding in the darkness never takes you up
Climb up the cliff,
A brand-new outlook awaits

I'm falling back down again if you care
Don't leave me here
I need you by my side

And into the warmth of daylight!

Hey! it's great to be alive
Hiding in the darkness never takes you up
Climb up the cliff,
A brand-new outlook awaits

Reach high above the clouds
And maybe, you can find a pot of gold
If we keep on living for the sky

Day in and day out
We are overwhelmed with worries
But don't let them get you down
Keep on reaching for the sky
