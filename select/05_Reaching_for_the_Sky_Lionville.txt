In time I will be all you need
Oh yes I will
But what will it take to feel right
Wish that I could love you tonight, ooh

I'll show you my secret cards
Giving all my heart to you
All of me

I'll be reaching for the sky with you
I don't care
If no one else believes
I have searched for someone like you
There will never be a safer place
For you and me

And now all my fears are over
Never thought that love could feel so strong
Soaring through the clouds

And there's no turning back
Now we have forever
And I know

I'll be reaching for the sky with you
I don't care
If no one else believes
I have searched for someone like you
There will never be a safer place
For you and me

I'll be reaching for the sky with you
I don't care
If no one else believes
I have searched for someone like you
There will never be a safer place
I'll be reaching for the sky with you
I don't care
If no one else believes
I have searched for someone like you
There will never be a safer place
For you and me
