There's a boy I used to know
He was always searching high and low
Others looked and wondered why
He said I am reaching for the sky

They say good will come to those who wait
Don't think too big, just know your place
People don't belong in clouds or space
It's just an empty quest for ego's sake

He said I'm be reaching for the sky
'Cause I have to see how high it goes
While others, they won't even try
I'll be reaching for the sky

Do the stars shine brighter there?
Can you really walk on air?
If other men have touched the moon
Then Saturn's rings could be mine soon

He said I'm reaching for the sky
'Cause I have to know how high it goes
While others, they won't even try
I'll be reaching for the sky
I'll be reaching for the sky
